# RaidouOS: A 64-bit multitasking graphical operating system
![](Raidou.png)
This is the repository for my little OS called Raidou. It handles mouse and keyboard input, has a round robin scheduler, uses double-buffering, has a simple windowing system with window movement, has a custom handwritten font and does a bunch of other things. Currently, the only program aside from the desktop/window manager is a terminal with two commands: "echo" and "id". If you want to contact me, my discord is aptrock327.
